_Ansible_
------------------
- Web server with Load balancers 
- Custom Inventory
  - `ansible -i inventory --list-hosts all`
- With *ansible.cfg*
  - `ansible --list-hosts all`
  - `ansible --list-hosts webservers`
  - `ansible --list-hosts loadbalancers`
- Ansible Tasks(run adhoc commands)
  - `ansible -m ping all`
  -  *(ansible command) (module flag) (module name) (inventory)*
  - `ansible --list-hosts "*"`
  - `ansible --list-hosts app*`
  - `ansible --list-hosts webservers:loadbalancers # using group functions`
  - `ansible --list-hosts \!control # using negate function`
  - `ansible --list-hosts webservers[0:10]`
  - `ansible -m ping all`
  - With *uname*, `RC=0,Success`
  - `ansible -m shell -a "uname" webservers:local`
  - `ansible -m shell -a "uname" app1:local`
  - `ansible -m shell -a "uname" local`
  - Return code `RC=1,Failure`
  - `ansible -m command -a "/bin/false" \!loadbalancers`
- Playbook
  - processes & manage configuration
  - run synchronously & asynchronously
  - ability to create infrastructure as code and manage it all in source control
  - list out everything we need & want to apply to each instance
  - Group them accordingly to configuration usage
  - Ensure they are in a logically defined order
  - Run each tasks according to the order they are listed
  - Example: update, install, configure check status etc
  - Run each tasks according to the order they are listed
- Service Handlers
- Import playbook
  - import_playbook: playbook_name
- Ansible adhoc command to stop apache
  - `ansible -m service -a "name=apache2 state=stopped"--become loadbalancers` 
- Variables
  - Gathers useful facts about host, that can be used in playbooks
  - Use *status* module to see all the facts gathered during the *TASK[Gathering Facts]*
  - Use *jinja2* template and expressions
  - `ansible -m setup app1`
  - Variables from info returned from tasks; call the registered variables for later use
    - `register: dir_contents`
  - Use debug mode
- Roles
  - Ansible provides framework that makes each part of variables, tasks, templates & modules fully independent
  - Group tasks together in a way that is self containing.
  - Predefiend directory structure 
  - Break configurations into files
  - Reuse code by others for similar configurations
  - Use `ansible-galaxy webservers init` to create predefined framework of roles
- Check Mode("Dry Run"): Reports changes that Ansible would have to make on the end hosts rather than applying the changes
  - Run Ansible without affecting the remote system
  - Reports changes back
  - Use at one node at a time basic(example: configuration management)
  - `ansible-playbook settings-app.yaml --check` [`--check` flag to check the status]
- Error Handling in Playbooks
  - `changed_when: false`
  - `ignore_errors: yes`
  - TODO
